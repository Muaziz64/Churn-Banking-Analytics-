# 📊 Customer Churn Analysis

A data science project using **Python** to analyze customer churn in the banking sector. This project uses **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover patterns and relationships between customer demographics, behavior, and churn outcomes.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

To identify key factors responsible for customer churn in a bank using data visualization and statistical analysis, helping institutions reduce attrition through data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📁 Dataset Details

- **File:** `Bank_Churn.csv`
- **Source:** Public dataset (simulated bank customer data)
- **Attributes:**
  - CreditScore
  - Geography
  - Gender
  - Age
  - Tenure
  - Balance
  - NumOfProducts
  - HasCrCard
  - IsActiveMember
  - EstimatedSalary
  - Exited (Target Variable - Churn: 1 = Yes, 0 = No)

---

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy

---

## 🔍 EDA Steps Performed

1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset
2. Handled missing values and checked data types
3. Visualized churn distribution
4. Analyzed impact of demographic features (Age, Gender, Geography)
5. Analyzed customer behavior (Tenure, Product usage, Activity)
6. Explored financial indicators (Credit Score, Balance, Salary)
7. Calculated correlation matrix and Pearson correlation

---

## 🎯 Key Insights

- Customers aged 40+ and inactive users had higher churn rates.
- German customers showed significantly more churn.
- Tenure, number of products, and account balance influenced churn risk.
- Salary and credit score had minimal impact.

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included

- Bar and Pie charts (Churn distribution)
- Countplots and Histograms (Demographics)
- Boxplots (Behavioral & Financial patterns)
- Heatmap (Feature correlation)

---

## ✅ Final Result

This EDA-based analysis helped uncover high-risk customer segments, enabling banks to strategize better retention campaigns.

---

## 📌 Future Scope

- Implement Machine Learning models for churn prediction
- Add customer feedback or transaction patterns
- Cluster customers based on risk profiles
